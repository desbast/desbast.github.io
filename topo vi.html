			<p> The following maps were generated as a part of a large-print-series. For sale are large cartographic prints spanning a specific section of topography in the Pacific North-West. The source data was extracted from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) database maintained by the government of British Columbia. In all, 178 DEM scan files were sourced to compile Vancouver Island, and then stitched together using a mosaicking tool within a mapping analytics software. The master
DEM now created from the 178 scans was then put through
a sink fill process, removing any smaller dataset imperfections. The result of this was then put through a flow-direction
render, assigning values to individual data cells pertaining to
their respective steepest downslope neighbor. This output
was then fed through a flow accumulation process, rendering
a rather beautiful raster that indicates accumulation points.
The accumulation raster was then ran through a single
output map-algebra equation that defined the river network
as having a 3000 flow accumulation unit cut-off. This could
have ranged any number between 0-10000, however in
this case, 3000 made the most sense visually to delineate
between ocean and river. This was probably the most tedious
selection to make in the process, as Vancouver Island is quite
porous, with many inlets blurring the lines between river and
ocean.
The output was then classified to a 6 part Strahler stream
order, separating the assumed flows into categories that
can then descend visually. This was then converted into
vector graphics, ensuring a tidy print made up of operable
components. WIP: a client has requested a mounted 3d-print of Vancouver Island. More on this to come! </p>
